ONLINE COURSE PLATFORM
A full-stack learning marketplace that allows users to discover online courses, enables instructors to publish and manage their content, and provides administrators the tools to oversee the entire platform. The system is built with a Spring Boot REST API and a modern front-end application, sharing a MySQL data store seeded with realistic course data.
